# CLI

You can get started using Storacha right away from your command line using our command line interface tool. Additionally, if you use the CLI, you can sign up using your Github credentials!

In this guide, we'll walk through the following steps:

1. [Installing the CLI tool](#install)
2. [Creating and provisioning your first space](#create-your-first-space)
3. [Uploading a file or directory](#upload-files)
4. [Viewing your file with IPFS](#view-your-file-with-ipfs)

## Install

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version `18` or higher, with NPM version `7` or higher to complete this guide.

You can check your local versions like this:

```bash
node --version && npm --version
```

Install the `@storacha/cli` package with `npm`

```bash
npm install -g @storacha/cli
```

Once the install is complete, you'll have a `storacha` command available. Try running `storacha --help` to get an idea of what's possible.

### Standalone Binaries

<Callout type="warning">
  These binaries are built from the Go client codebase which is not as fully featured as the JS client.
</Callout>

Pre-compiled, standalone binaries are now available for MacOS, Linux and Windows: [Download latest release](https://github.com/storacha/guppy/releases/latest).

We strongly recommend reading the [Go CLI documentation](https://github.com/storacha/guppy#cli). These binaries are built from the Go client codebase which is not as fully featured as the JS client. To use the Go CLI tool, you will need to obtain a delegation created by the JS CLI or [console](https://console.storacha.network).

## Create Your First Space

Everything uploaded to Storacha is associated with a <abbr id="space">"Space"</abbr>. A space is a unique identifier that acts as a namespace for your content.

Spaces are identified by <abbr id="did">DID</abbr> using keys created locally on your devices. To use a space for uploads, it needs to be registered with Storacha by providing an email address.

To create a space using the `storacha` command line tool, use the `storacha space create` command. You should give your space a "friendly" name, which acts like an alias for the space's DID and can make it easier to tell your spaces apart. Names for spaces cannot be changed at this time. In the example below, we'll use the name `Documents`:

```bash
storacha space create Documents
```

The DID for the new space will be printed to the console. It should look something like this, although the part after `did:key` will be unique to your space:

```bash
did:key:z6MkixXechJLc3TWibQj9RN6AiFx8VoMY9HNB3Y97WcwK3fm
```

You can now run `storacha space ls` to show a list of your spaces:

```bash
* did:key:z6MkixXechJLc3TWibQj9RN6AiFx8VoMY9HNB3Y97WcwK3fm Documents
```

The `*` symbol indicates that the `Documents` space is currently _active_. If you make multiple spaces, you can switch between them with `storacha space use`, passing in the name or DID of the space you want to activate.

## Upload Files

Now that you've [created and registered a space](#create-space), you're ready to upload files to Storacha!

Use the `storacha up` command to upload a file or directory:

```bash
storacha up your-file.txt
```

Once your upload is complete, you should see a URL that links to your file on the `storacha.link` <abbr id="gateway">IPFS gateway</abbr>.

If you uploaded a single file, the link will resolve to an IPFS directory listing, with the actual file contained in the directory. This "wrapper" directory preserves the original filename of your upload, which can help organize your content and allows people to download files using their original names. If you don't want to create the wrapper directory, you can pass in the `--no-wrap` flag when running `storacha up`.

When uploading directories, files beginning with a `.` character are ignored by default. To include hidden files instead, pass in the `-H` or `--hidden` flag.

## View Your File with IPFS

When your upload completes, you should see a link to your files on the `storacha.link` <abbr id="gateway">IPFS gateway</abbr>. Just click the link to see your file!
